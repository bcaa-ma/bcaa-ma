Face Shields by Teens is a group of teenagers in the Greater Boston area who are passionate about supporting our medical professionals. We design and create face shields for our front-line medical workers.

Our entirely volunteer-based team members have been creating these face shields. Our volunteers have devoted their time, materials, and funds (spent on necessities such as clear binding covers, duct tape, tongue depressors, fabric strips, Velcro, and foam for face shields) to this project, and hope to deliver these face shields to hospitals in the local area.

Here is a minimum supply cost breakdown. We plan to make 2000 face shields for design #1 and 1000 face shields for design #2. Thatâ€™s a total of 3000 face shields. It adds up to $7630.
