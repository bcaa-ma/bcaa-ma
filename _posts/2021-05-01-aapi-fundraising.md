May is Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month, a time to celebrate the rich cultures, history, and achievements of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPI).

AAPIs have made significant contributions to the United States that helped shape our country into what it is today. However, AAPIs were often in the face of cruel racism and prejudice. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought to light long-simmering anti-Asian racism, and there has been a disturbing increase in anti-Asian violence and crime. In the past two months, many of our Belmont AAPI neighbors and friends participated in protests, rallies, and public speeches to express concerns about the worsening anti-Asian racism in our country.
